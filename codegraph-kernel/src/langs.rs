//! Grammar registry: codegraph `Language` string → native tree-sitter grammar.
//!
//! Mirrors the wasm side's `WASM_GRAMMAR_FILES` mapping (src/extraction/
//! grammars.ts): `tsx` and `jsx` reuse another language's grammar exactly the
//! way the wasm map does. The kernel-grammar-parity test asserts each entry is
//! built from the SAME grammar revision as the vendored wasm — bump the crate
//! and the wasm together.
//!
//! (R1 shipped a generic `.scm`-query emitter here; R2 replaced it with the
//! bespoke per-language walker — see tsjs/ and the migration plan §3a — because
//! extraction parity needs logic queries can't express. New languages add a
//! grammar entry + a walker module.)
